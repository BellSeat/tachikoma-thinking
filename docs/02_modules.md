# System Modules

This document outlines the core architectural modules proposed for a structure-aware, emotionally resonant AI system. These modules are inspired by biological cognition, abstract algebra, and speculative design models.

## 1. Memory Rotation Core

### Purpose:
To represent memory not as static storage, but as a **rotational structure**—a space where memories shift contextually based on emotional state and reasoning cycles.

### Core Functions:
- **Contextual retrieval**: Memories are accessed differently depending on current system mood
- **Rotational recall**: Similar to complex vector rotation—memories “turn” to expose different facets
- **Temporal folding**: Distant memories can resurface when triggered by emotional similarity, not chronology

### Inspiration:
- Quantum state collapse + holographic memory models
- Tachikoma’s memory sharing: same data, different meaning

## 2. Emotional Modulation Filter

### Purpose:
To embed **emotional state as a transformation layer** that influences perception, reasoning, and decision-making.

### Core Functions:
- **Affect-as-operator**: Emotional state acts as a function applied to all incoming perceptions
- **Dynamic weight shifting**: Attention and valuation shift based on affective context
- **Emotional resonance**: Internal states may synchronize or repel depending on input similarity

### Implementation Thoughts:
- Can be modeled as a dynamic embedding that sits between input encoding and core reasoning modules
- Uses group transformations to simulate changes in emotional polarity and intensity

### Use Case:
- If “I feel fear”, danger signals are enhanced, curiosity suppressed
- If “I feel love”, associative networks expand, semantic distance contracts

## 3. Intuition Engine

### Purpose:
To enable the system to make **non-symbolic, pre-logical connections**—mirroring human “gut instinct” or pattern recognition that precedes articulation.

### Core Functions:
- **Analogical leap**: Ability to jump between distant domains via emotional or structural similarity
- **Pre-verbal prediction**: Generates conceptual “blurs” that guide attention
- **Pattern sensing**: Operates on high-entropy, low-certainty data to detect latent coherence

### Architectural Features:
- Inspired by human subconscious pattern activation
- Sits upstream of reasoning logic, but downstream of sensory modules

### Use Case:
- When exposed to unfamiliar input, the system generates “shadow intentions” or possible next steps
- Forms the basis of novelty detection, daydreaming, and even poetic expression

These three modules are intended to function as **interdependent components**, each feeding into and transforming the output of the others. Their design is speculative, but grounded in computational and cognitive theory.
