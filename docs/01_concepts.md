# Core Concepts

## 1. What Is “Thinking” in This System?

In this architecture, thinking is not optimization. It is not prediction as probability. Thinking is **structure-aware transformation**:

- Recognizing internal conflicts and integrating them
- Applying transformations across emotional or perceptual domains
- Mapping between intention, perception, and operation

We seek to build systems that **change state based on inner reasoning**, not just external stimuli.

## 2. Group Theory and Mental Transformations

Group theory provides a language for modeling operations between internal states.

- **Abelian group**: represents symmetrical, interchangeable thought (e.g. “joy + peace = peace + joy”)
- **Non-Abelian group**: introduces order-dependency (e.g. “loss → fear → rage” ≠ “rage → fear → loss”)
- **Emotional rotation**: love and hate are not opposites but rotational states on a complex feeling axis
- **Subgroups** could represent emotional subtypes, moods, or filtered worldviews

Group operations model how ideas, feelings, and interpretations **transform into each other**.

## 3. The VtO Module (Vision-to-Operation)

This module models the path from perception to action:

- Input: a perceived object, situation, or phrase
- Mapping: internal representations via group-defined transformation rules
- Output: intention or operation (e.g., movement, response, decision)

This is inspired by:
- The human sensorimotor loop
- Symbolic-to-embodied cognition pathways
- Reinforcement learning with embedded subjective states

## 4. Emotion as Computable Structure

Emotion is treated as a **filter over world modeling**. In this system:

- Emotions are vector-like structures with group behavior
- Emotional state affects interpretation, memory access, and valuation
- Pain, joy, anxiety become **modulators of logic flow**

We are not imitating emotion—we are embedding its computational consequences.

## 5. Synesthetic Processing

Ideas here are cross-modal:

- **Sound evokes texture**, like emotion evoking memory
- Images are not static—they trigger operations
- Memory isn't storage—it's rotation, resonance

Goal: to model how the mind uses **analogous senses** to amplify or suppress responses.

---

## 6. Language Geometry

Language is not linear—it is **structured space**:

- Grammar as rules of movement
- Words as operations or vectors
- Metaphor as a rotation across concept domains

We propose a system where syntax and semantics are **actions**, not just labels. Parsing is not decoding—it is **motion through idea-space**.
