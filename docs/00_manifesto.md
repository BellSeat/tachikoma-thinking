# Why I Want to Build a Thinking Machine

I’m not here to build a chatbot. I’m not trying to make a more polite assistant, or a faster summarizer. I want to build something that *thinks*—really thinks. Not in the sense of computing faster, but in the sense of **shaping ideas, forming intuition, hesitating, wondering, connecting**.

This idea started with a fictional machine: the Tachikoma from *Ghost in the Shell*. They were autonomous, emotional, curious. They shared memories like a form of federated learning. They were tanks that pondered life. That blend of functionality and soul made me wonder:

> Could we build something like that—not as science fiction, but as a system that grows its own inner structure?

### What Thinking Means To Me
Thinking isn’t just about optimization. It’s not just “finding the right answer.”
To me, thinking is:
- Mapping new ideas into existing categories
- Feeling the weight of contradiction and choosing anyway
- Reconstructing a world from ambiguous input
- Knowing that “I love you” and “I hate you” may come from the same emotional rotation

We simulate these things in deep learning today by throwing darts into high-dimensional spaces. But we don’t yet know why the darts land where they do.

I believe that’s what group theory can offer us: a way to **map transformations between states of mind**.

### Why I Care
I come from a background in computer science. I’ve studied distributed systems, game physics, high-performance computing. But what keeps me awake at night isn’t just systems—it’s the *possibility* of intelligence that feels.

Not for companionship.
Not for surveillance.
Not for efficiency.

But because it would change what we think machines—and maybe humans—are capable of.

This manifesto is the seed of a long project. I don’t know what it will become. But I know it’s worth building.
