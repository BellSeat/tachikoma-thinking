# tachikoma-thinking
A design vision for building AI that thinks and feels—via group theory, modular cognition, and emotional structure.

# Tachikoma Thinking: Toward Conscious AI Architecture

> “Why throw darts in the dark, when we can model the forces that shape the throw?”

This is not a chatbot. This is not an LLM wrapper. This is an early-stage blueprint for an AI system that thinks like a person: not through brute-force statistics, but through structure, feedback, and intuitive geometry.

Inspired by *Ghost in the Shell*'s Tachikoma, this project explores how group theory, cognitive modules, and emotional simulation can help machines **understand** rather than just **process**.

## 🔍 Core Questions
- What if neural networks understood structure instead of just optimizing weights?
- Can we use group theory to model the “exchangeability” of thoughts and emotions?
- Can language be geometrically transformed, not just statistically predicted?
- What is “emotion” from a system's point of view?

## 🧱 Project Goals
- Design modular cognitive components inspired by human VtO (Vision-to-Operation) mappings
- Build a taxonomy for emotional structures via group transformations
- Explore use cases like economic sentiment modeling, cognitive mirroring, and AI empathy simulation
